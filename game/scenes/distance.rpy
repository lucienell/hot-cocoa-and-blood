      Of course, this tale of mine skips many events of our daily life.

      By focusing on our relationship to BDSM,{w} by focusing on some key moments that now stand out to me,{w} I am glossing over acts of love and intimacy:{w} the joy of cooking together.{w} Our dates.{w} Flowers gifted.{w} Discussions in the night.{w} Games played together,{w} movies watched together.{w} Laughter, shared jokes, hopes and dreams for the future.

      There was always some reason to hold onto our relationship,{w} to hope something could be fixed.{w} Amélie and I made some efforts,{w} we did talk,{w} we made some resolutions -{w} but they weren’t enough.

      Amélie promised that she could be happy without me hurting her -{w} and she truly thought so at the time.{w} Never mind that I liked our scenes,{w} that I only disliked her behaviour afterward;{w} it felt like a good solution at the time.

      Unfortunately for us, Amélie eventually settled back in a behaviour marred with fear, distrust.{w} She was more distant, and more angry with herself.

      If we had had more occasions to spend time together, we might have been able to work this through.{w} Unfortunately for our relationship, our schedules never quite aligned:{w} a barmaid and a mortician do not exactly share the same working hours.

      When we had first become girlfriends, we did not have such a problem.{w} I had come to Paris in hope to find employment, for the village where I lived, back in Provence{w} (Cavaillon, if you ask),{w} did not provide me with many opportunities to work as an embalmer.{w} It was also an opportunity for me to meet other queer people, to make friends,{w} to reinvent my life in a place where no one knew who I had been.

      The point is, when Amélie and I had met, I had not yet found a stable job.{w} By the time we got together, I occasionally worked as an independent contractor and my hours were highly irregular.{w} Yet, this arrangement meant that we could spend time together during the afternoon, provided I had no other engagement.

      At this point in time, back when the first cracks in our relationship had shown,{w} I had, at last, found a salaried position with consistent hours and consistent pay, at a big corporation.{w} But that position came with a more strict schedule that mainly took place between 10am and 5pm.

      Amélie, meanwhile, worked from 6pm to 2am.{w} She was asleep when I left for work, and I was asleep when she came back from hers.

      I was left alone, in a place full of noise and people and alcohol,{w} and, frankly, this was too much when I just wanted to rest.

      What made the situation worse still is that Amélie was the first person in Paris with whom I really felt connected and that,{w} rather than make friends of my own,{w} I became a part of her friend group.

      Ever since we had gotten together,{w} we had always brewed cocoa when we woke up,{w} no matter the time of the day.{w} Depending on my work hours,{w} I could sometimes stay at home when Amélie woke up,{w} and I would bring her a cup in bed.
