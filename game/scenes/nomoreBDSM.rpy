      Unbeknownst to me, Amélie had made a plan.

      After one too many fights, she had reached the same conclusion I did in my exhaustion:{w} she wanted to stop doing BDSM with me.

      She had figured that,{w} if the topic always made us fight,{w} if it had stopped bringing us joy,{w} she could make up for it elsewhere.{w} And so, she took on some more responsibilities at the bar:{w} she helped organise kink events, parties, workshops.

      She also got more invested in her associative work.

      She had been part of a transgender group for a while, mostly to meet with friends;{w} now, she was starting new projects,{w} discussion groups on specific topics,{w} and helped with various organising demonstrations,{w} not realising the weight of all this new responsibility.

      I suspect Amélie flirted a lot, during that period.{w} Looking to fill in some gap, enjoying the attention -{w} and also behaving like she always had before we met, without thinking of what it meant.
