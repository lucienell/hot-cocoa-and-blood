    So when she asked me out, when I agreed and we came to be together, her sudden shyness came as a surprise.{w} I could notice that a shadow loomed over her head whenever there came the topic of intimacy;{w} the girl who kept talking about sex toys, past partners and unusual kinks had become so demure that she would never ask for us to have sex.
    
    While she had often rested her head on my shoulder or hugged me without a thought when we were friends, she looked for my consent to hold my hand with a concerned look on her face.{w} Sometimes, she unconsciously groped my chest, and this made me smile, but still she apologised when she noticed what she had just done.

    Yes. I could tell that she was not fully herself when we lay together in the same bed.{w} When we kissed and cuddled, naked, and I humped her body, feeling so lucky to be with her, her thoughts were far, far away.

    It worried me.

    I loved her. I didn’t want sex to be a burden to her, and I apologised - I thought I had gone too far and too fast.
    
    I told her that I had presumed that she really loved sex because she kept calling herself a “slut”, and that I could wait, or not have any sex altogether, that she was more important than any lust{w} - but this made her quiver and shake her head.

    “Please, no. No. I, I like sex. I just. I don’t want you to hate me.”

    I assured her that I could never hate her.
    
    Still, Amélie could not bring herself to tell me what worried her: she blushed and refused to look me in the eyes.

    I told her I could wait until she was ready to talk, and that I would always be there, ready to listen… but it was obvious that it had weighed on her.{w} 
    
    She wanted to tell me.
    But she felt too ashamed.

    I tentatively took some guesses to relieve her: had something happened to her?{w} A previous partner?{w} (No - well, not really){w}
    Was she afraid to ruin our relationship?{w} (A nod){w} 
    If she feared I would hate her… was it that she did not find me desirable?

    “No! No, that’s not it at all!”

    By that time, she had buried her face in her hands, facing away from me.{w} She looked ready to run away, and so I ceased my questioning, embarrassed, curious, sad and a little vexed that she would not tell me.

    Eventually, she sat up.{w} I thought she would leave, and I could not understand what I had done wrong - but instead, she went to fetch a slip of paper, and she wrote something on it.

    She handed it to me. The whole time that I read, she nervously drummed her fingers together, always fidgeting, so certain that I would flee.

    I felt so touched, being allowed to see her in such a vulnerable light, so ready to break.{w} I was honoured that she chose to trust me in spite of the fear that clearly held her.{w} So I assured her of my love, and of my understanding: that I would not try to “fix her”, that I did not think that she was weird, that I did not think she was hateful for wanting to be hurt.{w} I had long suspected that she was into BDSM - the choker, the constant puns, her attitude were such a giveaway - and I loved her for who she was.

    If she wanted me to hurt her, if that’s what it took for her to enjoy sex, then I was ready to give this to her.

    I promised her I would never judge her, that I would never make her feel ashamed of her desires, and that I wanted to know more so I could satisfy her.

    I will always remember how she leaped to hug me, so ready to cry, so full of relief.

    I held her tight, vowing I would never let go.

    We talked about her kinks that night. I still have the list she made.

    Intimacy restored / Primarily centered on Amélie’s desires, her excitement to share her desires.{w} Leïla listens, she wants to satisfy Amélie. Romantic tones.

    Afterwards, the shadows were lifted.{w} There was an ease to Amélie’s voice and to her movements: what had only been puns about wanting to be stepped on and various remarks that she always retracted when I pressed her had now become open fantasies.{w} She hugged me, sank her hands into my body, delighted that she could touch me, delighted I would touch her in return.

    Faced with a bottle of alcohol, she asked me if I wanted to make her drink until she could not stand, so I could have my way with her, not considering that my religion forbade me from touching alcohol (or maybe she thought that it was okay if she was the one drinking?).

    When a friend smoked, she later told me that she longed to be used like an ashtray, to have cigarettes ground into her - that she swooned when she thought of the pain this would bring her, all for so small a convenience! The appeal was in the sheer unbalance.

    Choking, kidnapping, rape play, face slaps, being locked in a closet, being kept as a doll or as a pet, being spat on, having a gun held against her head and being eaten alive - she delved into all these topics and so many more with such earnestness, always explaining why she liked them like I would not understand and judge her for them - or like she was relieved to finally have someone understand and love that part of her, that part that she would flaunt to friends and strangers, and hide to her partners.

    Throughout our conversations, I listened.{w} I never looked away, I never expressed the pity or the disgust that she feared I would feel when I would know who she truly was.

    I endeavoured to treat her with respect.{w} I did not interrupt her, I answered truthfully when she asked me what I thought and if I would agree to do this to her.{w} That time our friend smoked, seeing how excited she was at the prospect of becoming an ashtray, I paused and gave it an honest thought; I was not a smoker.{w} Still, I asked her if she knew where the nearest tobacco store was, and she crossed her arms with surprise.

    Amélie: What? No! Smoking is bad for your health, and cigarettes are too expensive.{w} It’s just a fantasy, I don’t want you to do that to me.
