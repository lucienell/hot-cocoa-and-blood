      Amélie was right when she said I was gentle and soft.{w} I care for my partners.{w} I love them, I want them to feel cherished.{w} This has led me to fulfilling the roles they expect of me: most often, this meant I was a top.

      I am quite tall, and, as a result, many girls have told me that they wanted me to step on them.{w} Between this, the expectations people have of a trans woman and the tendency of many transgender girls to be subby bottoms, it was the norm for me to lead in bed.{w} To be active, to take.

      I never really questioned this: it felt so natural to have that role.

      I had grown up surrounded by such assumptions, after all:{w} back when people assumed I was a boy, I was often praised for my height or my broad shoulders.{w} I was told I would probably grow up to be a ladykiller.{w} And girls did notice me.{w} I was asked out several times, or pushed into relationships - I could never really understand why.{w} But I followed what was expected of me…{w} and I played the boyfriend’s part.{w} I learnt how to act.

      So, it came as a surprise when lesbians praised me for my height, even before I came to Paris.

      I distinctly remember that time, at the meet-up, where I had told that I was looking to make friends and someone joked that it would not take long for me to break some hearts with how tall I was.

      For some reason, it did not feel good at all.

      It felt… othering.{w} Like I was receiving the same kind of compliments that I had received before.{w} Like what was loved were precisely the parts of me that made me feel less of a woman.
