    nvl_narrator "Every morning, I would awake to the smell of hot cocoa that came from the kitchen."
    nvl_narrator "Our room was warm, bathed in sunlight."
    nvl_narrator "There was an empty spot in bed, right to where I lay, still full of Amélie’s shape."
    nvl_narrator "Before we met, we both had trouble waking up in the morning. Every day, I would hit the snooze button on my alarm, only to do it again ten minutes later."

    nvl clear

    nvl_narrator "I didn’t want to leave the comfort of my bed, the warmth of the sheets, or my half-forgotten dreams."
    nvl_narrator "I didn’t even sleep well after the first alarm : there can be no rest when you know you’re dallying and should already be on your way. At the back of my mind,
    I always thought about the time I had left before the next alarm. I would feel exhausted before I had even set a foot on the floor."
    nvl_narrator "After I met Amélie – no, when we woke up together at the sound of a common alarm, hugging each other in the same bed – it became easier.
    The weight of fatigue didn’t disappear all of a sudden (for love cannot cure one's health), but I had a reason to stay awake."    
    nvl_narrator "In those days, I want to believe that I was happy."
    nvl_narrator "Even when our rhythms diverged, and she came to wake earlier than I, I kept my drive. Although I would have loved to cuddle with Amélie,
    to bury myself in her in hopes that we would merge together forever more, I could rise with ease, so appealing was the prospect to join the one I loved and enjoy her cooking."

    sub "Ah! You’re awake! Good morning darling!"

    "The moment she heard me, she perked up. Her head darted towards me in a swift motion, and she was all smiles,
    not unlike a lamb who has just seen her mother and runs towards her, elated to see her again, and nuzzles against her wool."
    "There was such a stark contrast between how she was when she focused on brewing hot cocoa for us – lost, relaxed, distant, or perhaps dreaming,
    stirring the pot without a thought for it ; her movements were automatic – and her attitude when she saw me."
    "She hasn’t lost that joy. Today still, she loves me and loves being with me."

    sub "I’m almost done! I’ll join you in the living room soon, go take your meds."
    dom "Nope."
    "I moved in to embrace her, to kiss her head over and over. Mwah, mwah, mwah."
    sub "Eheheh, what are you doing?~"
    dom "I’ll stop kissing when you stop being this cute."
    sub "Oh no! But I’m adorable!"
    dom "Yes. You are."

    "Mwah."
    "She kept giggling."
    "I think her enthusiasm is the reason I fell for her. I certainly felt like I loved her more and more, day after day, as I kissed her,
    loved her, and she kissed me in return, assuring me all the while that she felt ever so lucky to be with me."
    "She expressed such undiluted pleasure, joy and affection that I never doubted that she truly loved me."

    "We stayed like this, muttering sweet nothings and thinking of the day to come for a while. The chocolate had melted in the pan,
    and Amélie kept stirring to ensure it would mix well with the milk."
    "I lost myself within the whirl, enjoying every smell: the warmth of the chocolate,
    the faintest dash of vanilla. Milk too; but that was an aroma less pleasant, and it soon faded away to become cocoa."
    "Amélie’s smell, too. Easily my favourite." 

    sub "Oh, just so you know, we don’t have much chocolate left."
    dom "Drat. I’m adding that to our grocery list. Looks like we’re missing vanilla too."
    sub "Yup! And we’ll have to go to the store, cause it’s not like there is anything vanilla about me!"

    sub "Ha ha. Sorry."

    nvl_narrator "We poured the cocoa in our mugs and went to the living room. Amélie took no time in drinking her own:
    it was as though she didn’t care for the boiling heat of the beverage, and, sometimes, she would have finished her mug before I took my first sip."
    nvl_narrator "There was something astounding in her haste, and I would wonder time and time again if she could taste anything through the heat."
    nvl_narrator "As for the pain, Amélie had proved time and time again her ability to withstand it: be as it may,
    I had long since accepted that she and I had nothing in common on that front, and that something that would make me cry in agony, she would welcome quite happily."
    nvl_narrator "Why, most of the time, she even moaned."
    nvl_narrator "\[Cocoa taste? Imperfect. There\’s chunks at the bottom that didn\’t mix well. But it was made with love. It clings to the spoon. You can suck on it.\]"

    nvl_narrator "There was still some time left before the laundry cycle would be done, and more time still before we would have to leave for work, so we settled on the sofa and started watching some videos on YouTube together. That day, it was something about bunkers and how they work; more of an analysis of the use of the theme in science-fiction and some experiments than a practical dive into their inner workings. The parts pertaining to their contemporary use in face of climate change were tangential. Nonetheless, it was entertaining and interesting."
    nvl_narrator "It was cosy and oh so domestic."

    dom "Oh, right, my meds. I almost forgot."
    sub "Shoot ! My gel ! I knew I was forgetting something."
    "She stood in a hurry while I grabbed the medication from the top drawer of my desk. It didn’t take long before I could hear her wince and curse."
    sub "Why must they put alcohol in this thing? Don’t they know this stuff hurts?"

    "I kept looking at the screen without saying a word, trying to ignore the knot that threatened to grow in my stomach. Mechanically, I took my meds. The warmth that spread through my mouth and throat made me notice that I had swallowed them by drinking my hot cocoa."
    sub "I swear… at least this will disinfect the wounds. Again. I guess I should also put on some cream but my arms are already covered in gel. Uuurgh…"
    #[Amélie comes back on screen. Cuts visible on the arm?]
    sub "And I can’t even hug you when I’m like this! I swear, this is transphobic!"
    dom "I really don’t think E gel is transphobic."
    sub "Not hugging you certainly is transphobic!"
    dom "I guess it is, yeah."

    "Despite it, she nuzzled my shoulder with her head, and that sign of affection was enough to douse the worry at the back of my mind, and we were once more a loving pair. Amélie chided me for not having waited for her, and she rewound the video back."
    "It was clear that she no longer thought about the wounds on her arm, for she didn’t make any comment, and neither did she marvel at \“how pretty they were\”."
    "My own reasons pushed me to ignore them and to not look at the cuts and bruises glistening beneath the gel. I much preferred to leave all those marks behind, lock them behind the bedroom door and pay them no heed once we were done. In a way, her nonchalant attitude helped me achieve that."
    "Time went by. Early morning eventually came to a pass. We couldn’t postpone preparing for work or we would risk being late, and so we paused the video. I took our mugs to the dishwasher. The laundry machine had completed its cycle. We would have to make haste if we were to hang them in time."

    dom "Can you please get the rack?"
    sub "Yes Miss!"
    dom "Thank you, love."

    nvl_narrator "Inside was a bundle of white sheets. I distinctly remember how they felt: they were heavy with cold water, and so different from our usual laundry, so fresh and warm. Still, I took them out. I diligently inspected them, looking for any speck of dried blood."
    nvl_narrator "To my relief, the cold wash had worked: there was no ugly brown to be found amidst the white."
    nvl_narrator "There had been so much blood yesterday. More than I had ever seen spilt in my life."
    nvl_narrator "I had truly thought that my sheets would never recover from the scene; that they would forever remind me of the way I had – but they were clean, and I had to hang them to dry, so I went to the living room where Amélie had deployed the clothes rack. She sat at the desk, surfing or playing on the computer, this I did not see fully."

    nvl_narrator "Although I wished for her to be more proactive with the chores, I let her be. When she so desired, Amélie could be the most diligent maid I could have asked for. The rest of the time, she tarried, and she let herself be caught into the computer’s web."
    nvl_narrator "Had I given her the order, she would have happily hung the sheets: Amélie did every thing I asked of her. This, perhaps, is precisely the reason why I did it all by myself without saying a word: I feared fostering this tendency of hers."
    nvl_narrator "I have never wanted her to see me as her Mistress foremost."
    nvl_narrator "Can’t a girl want her girlfriend to help around the house out of duty and love rather than out of lust?"

    "The task was easily done, although I had to use some chairs as an improvised rack to avoid putting everything on top of each other. It was time to leave, and I began dressing myself. By the time I was done, Amélie was still on the computer, oblivious to the time."

    dom "We need to go, can you get dressed?"
    sub "Oh, yes, sorry."

    "She quickly sat up from her chair and took off her pajamas in front of me, leaving them on her desk."
    "She was beautiful."
    "In this moment, I desired nothing more than to grab her and push her against the wall, to put my hand on her chest, on her butt, on her hips and grope every part of her being: to let her know how much I loved her, how much I lusted for her; to hear her moan my name, thank me for the attention, thank me for using her."
    "I would make her mine. She loved when I told her she was mine."
    "But then, she turned around to show me her back, and everything about this fantasy collapsed…"

    sub "Oh! Tell me how it looks!"
    "…when I saw my name carved into the skin on her back."
    "Every letter red with blood."
    "Cuts uneven, rough. All angles, and no curves. Like a child writing uppercase out of a bundle of sticks."
    sub "Is it still legible?"
    "A mess of fine lines and opened wounds, where the skin had been cut open and gaped."
    "I could not look away."
    "I had done this to her."

    dom "Y-yeah. I. Hold on, I’ll take a picture for you."
    "She clapped and posed – she behaved exactly like she was trying out a new dress at the store, like she wanted to see how it fitted her, if I thought it made her look pretty. Like she wasn’t aware that I had carved scars on her back."
    sub "Lemme see!"
    sub "Oh! It’s gorgeous! Thank you thank you thank you! Hahaha! Yes!"
    "But there she was, right next to me, looking at the picture on my phone, hugging me in a fit of elation."
    "She truly thought these wounds made her look pretty."
    "She was euphoric, and oh so grateful."
    sub "I’m so glad! Normally they fade away after a night. I heal just way too easily. But this time, you really did it! I don’t think you ever cut that deep!"
    sub "Oh, I love you Leïla!"

    "She kissed me, again and again, with an energy she normally didn’t have. And her voice - it was so full of joy, of excitement, of - of worship. To her, I was a Goddess."
    "I didn’t want her to see how I felt. I couldn’t ruin her joy, spoil it with my worries. I was afraid she would feel guilt and be ashamed of herself."
    "I didn’t want to break my promise."
    "So I… I hugged her close to me. My arm brushed against her back, right against the scar. She made a small cry, right between pain and surprise. I sensed her tense against me for an instant, and then she laughed."
    sub "I should probably put on a bandage, and disinfect it again. A shame."
    dom "Yeah. That’s a good idea"

    "How could she not hear the emptiness in my voice? The distance?"
    "Probably because I made it impossible for her to."
    "I helped her with the wound. Carefully disinfecting it again, just like I did last night. Again, she winced. Again, she laughed. Something about her nerves, about that type of pain."
    sub "Thanks, babe."
    dom "Amélie?"
    sub "Yeah?"
    dom "I love you too."
    sub "I know! Eheheh."
    "She started turning around to embrace me, but I needed her to be still. I wasn’t done treating the wounds, and I didn’t want to let her wait any longer before I bandaged them. Not like yesterday night. So I kissed her on the nape of her neck, and I went back to my task."
    "By the time we were done and she got dressed, we were running late."
    "She didn’t want to leave me, and she whined when we had to go our separate ways."
    "I didn’t want her to leave me either."
    "I really, really wished I could stay in her arms. Even though she had just cuddled with me with an affection, a glee I had never quite seen in her… I still felt as though I needed a hug."
