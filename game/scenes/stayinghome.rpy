    In the end, I managed to convince Amélie to go to the doctor, so she would get prescribed time for sick leave.
    
    It took some coaxing, and the patient voice I normally used during aftercare: maternal, slow, tender, reassuring. {w} “You are okay now, and everything will be fine. I love you.”
    
    The idea that she might have cut her ties with her friends and lost her source of income terrified me to the point that I accompanied her back to the bar and stayed there the whole time, right up until 2 am. 

    Amélie walked very slowly on the road back to the bar, but, apart from that, the night ended without any further incident.
