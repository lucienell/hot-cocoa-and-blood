    So when she asked me out, when I agreed and we came to be together, her sudden shyness came as a surprise.
    
    I could notice that a shadow loomed over her head whenever there came the topic of intimacy:{w} the girl who kept talking about sex toys, past partners and unusual kinks had become so demure that she would never ask for us to have sex.
    
    While she had often rested her head on my shoulder or hugged me without a thought when we were friends,{w} she no longer dared hold my hand without my expressed consent.

    Sometimes, she unconsciously groped my chest, and this made me smile,{w} but still she apologised when she noticed what she had just done.

    Yes. I could tell that she was not fully herself when we lay together in the same bed.{w} When we kissed and cuddled, naked, and I humped her, feeling so lucky to be with her, her thoughts were far, far away.

    It worried me.

    By that time, she had buried her face in her hands, facing away from me.
    
    She looked ready to run away, and so I ceased my questioning, embarrassed, curious, sad and a little vexed that she would not tell me.

    Eventually, she sat up.
    
    I thought she would leave, and I could not understand what I had done wrong; but instead, she went to fetch a slip of paper, and wrote something on it.
