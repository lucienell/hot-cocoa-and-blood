      I loved doing BDSM with Amélie.

      I want to pretend that she’s the one responsible for the state of our current relationship -{w} that she’s the one who destroyed all our love and replaced it with that play where I must play the Mistress and she the slave -{w} but I can’t.{w} Amélie merely opened the door.
  
      Playing together brought me a rush of pure, undiluted power.{w} The knowledge that I only had to speak, and Amélie would do everything in her power to content me.
